# Examples for Distributed Graph Learning

This directory contains examples for distributed graph learning.
The examples are organized into two subdirectories:

1. `pyg`: Distributed training via PyG's own `torch_geometric.distributed` package.
1. `graphlearn_for_pytorch`: Distributed training via the external GraphLearn-for-PyTorch (GLT) package.
