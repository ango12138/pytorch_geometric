    r"""The Mesh Un-pooling operator from the `"MeshCNN: A Network with an
    Edge" <https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05910>`_ paper
    This class implements the un-pooling operation on a Mesh structure.
    We define mesh un-pooling as the partial inverse of the MeshPooling
    operation. This operation increase the number of mesh edges and, therefore,
    increase the resolution of the feature activations.
    Un-pooling operation does not have any learned parameters and it uses the
    Mesh history in order to recover the original resolution of the mesh. Each
    un-pooled edge feature is a weighted combination of the pooled edge
    features.

    Args:
        unroll_target (int): number of edges after un-pooling operation.
